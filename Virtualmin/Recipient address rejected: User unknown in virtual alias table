# Postfix Email Issue: "Recipient address rejected: User unknown in virtual alias table"

## Problem
When sending an email to a specific domain, Gmail responses are rejected with the following error in the logs:
550 5.1.1 construction@dlaconcu.com: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in virtual alias table


## Cause
This error occurs when the recipient email address is not recognized by Postfix. Specifically, Postfix does not have the correct virtual alias mapping for the recipient email address.

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Check Virtual Alias Table:**
   Ensure that the recipient email address is correctly defined in your Postfix virtual alias table file, typically located at `/etc/postfix/virtual`.

2. **Add the Virtual Alias:**
   Edit the `/etc/postfix/virtual` file and add the following line (replace the destination address as needed):
construction@dlaconcu.com your_local_user_or_alias@domain.com


3. **Update Postfix Alias Database:**
After editing the virtual alias file, run the following command to update the alias database:
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/virtual


4. **Reload Postfix:**
Reload Postfix to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl reload postfix


5. **Verify Configuration in `main.cf`:**
Ensure that the `virtual_alias_maps` directive is correctly set in `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:
virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual


6. **Test the Fix:**
Send another email to `construction@dlaconcu.com` and verify that the email is delivered without the "Recipient address rejected" error.
