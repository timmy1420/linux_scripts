    # Timeouts
    # The client_body_timeout and client_header_timeout directives are
    # responsible for the time a server will wait for a client body or
    # client header to be sent after request. If neither a body or header
    # is sent, the server will issue a 408 error or Request time out.
    #
    # The keepalive_timeout assigns the timeout for keep-alive connections
    # with the client. Simply put, Nginx will close connections with the
    # client after this period of time.
    #
    # Finally, the send_timeout is a timeout for transmitting a response
    # to the client. If the client does not receive anything within this
    # time, then the connection will be closed.
